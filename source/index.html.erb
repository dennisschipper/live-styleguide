  <p>When I first heard about <span class="marked-text">AngularJS it caught</span> my attention immediately because it appeared to offer a single framework that could be used to build a variety of dynamic, client-centric applications. After researching it more, my initial impressions were confirmed, and I was hooked. AngularJS includes a robust set of features and offers a way to break up code into modules, which is good for reuse, maintenance, and testability. It provides key features, such as support for DOM manipulation, animations, templating, two-way data binding, routing, history, Ajax, testing, and much more.</p>
